# Rock-Paper-Scissors

This project was made to allow a player to play a game of Rock,Paper, Scissors against a computer, that is using randomly generated moves. Three possible outcomes: a draw, a win or a loss. The games is presented as series of alerts, using DOM manipulation.


This project was buily using vanilla JavaScript.

This was one of my first projects, so the challenges I faced where centered on getting to grips with using JavaScript. This was solved with learning more about JavaScript and asking for input from my peers.


In the future, I would like to implememt some more features primarily a game user interface to enhance user experience.
